GShsModel1;Model - Part 1;Defines shoe model, assigned to the player. Each model is stored in 2 separate files (they can be located in the main game folder or in the "shoes" folder, which neighbours the "Saves" folder of the game) and has a unique 32-digit hex-code, identifying it. These codes are contained in shoe file names (the main file of each shoe model has a code, which is less by 1, than the secondary file's one). To assign a shoes model, you need to get the code, contained in the main file's name, and input it consecutively digit-by-digit into this and the 3 next fields, so each field contains exactly 8 digits. NOTE: the shoe brand MUST be appropriate to the model to get a positive result.
