IMPORTANT!!!

The program seems to be working very correctly and smoothly. Still, there are some things, you should know.

GENERAL:

1. Please, make sure, you run the program As Administrator.
2. Always BACK UP your files before you start editing them.
3*. Some unknown bugs still migth be in the program. Report me, if you find one, please.

IFF FILES EDITING:

1. Please, note, that files, edited with RED MC, are guaranteed to work correctly with RED MC and original games only.
   It is not guaranteed, that the files will work correctly with any other 3rd party software.

XBOX 360 SPECIFIC:

1. Do not extract inner files from saves.
2. Always Rehash&Resign before you put your file back to console.
3. Do not rename files outside the console.

PLAYSTATION 3 SPECIFIC:

1. Always decrypt your files before editing them with RED MC, and encrypt them back before you put them back to console.
   Recommended software to work with PS 3 saves is "Burteforce Save Data". You can find a tutorial in the Tutorials folder.
2. "Save As..." function is disabled for PS 3, since its saves consist of multiple tightly-connected files.
